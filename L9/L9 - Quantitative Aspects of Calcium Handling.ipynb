When we say intracellular calcium handling, we mean how calcium enters the cell, how it moves around inside the cell, and secondary effects that are triggered by it - most importantly, calcium is responsible for the contraction of the cell.\n",

    "# Excitation-Contraction Coupling in the Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 200 years ago, Luigi Galvani reported that the leg muscles of dead frogs would twitch if he created an electrical spark. This was the beginning of the study of *excitation-contraction coupling*, the process where electrical activation of a muscle cell causes it to contract. We have so far studied the cellular action potential in detail, and have seen how gated ion channels in the sarcolemma is responsible for producing a rapid depolarization, and then a slower repolarization, of the cell. We will now understand how the depolarization due to the action potential is coupled to contraction of the cell.\n",

    "### Calcium as a signaling molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcium is an important *signaling molecule* in the cell. A *signal* in this context just means something that starts some process in the cell, in this case contraction of the cell. Calcium is such an important signaling molecule because it has a very large *dynamical gain*, meaning it has large *relative* changes over time. This is true for calcium because the diastolic levels of cytosolic calcium are so extremely low, normally as low as ~100 nM. During the depolarizing phase of the action potential, a large amount of calcium rapidly enters into the cytosol, meaning the cytosolic levels can increase as much as a 1000-fold in only tens of milliseconds. In comparison, other ions, such as [Na$^+$] and [K$^+$] enter and leave the cell in equal magnitudes as calcium, but due to their much higher diastolic levels, their concentrations only change a few percent during the action potential. This rapid increase of calcium is called the *calcium transient*, because during the repolarization and resting phase of the action potential  the calcium levels decay back to resting levels, and so the increased calcium only exists *transiently*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/ca_transients.png\" width=500>\n",
    "**Figure:** The depolarizing phase of the action potential triggers a rapid and drastic increase in cytosolic calcium levels over only tens of millisecond. During the repolarizing and resting phase of the AP, the calcium levels return to diastolic levels, we call this the *calcium transient*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ion concentration only change a few percent, it is hard to imagine using that concentration change as a *signal* for anything, as there would be a very bad signal- to noise ratio. In comparison, a 1000-fold change would have no signal- to noise ratio, and so the calcium transient is an extremly clear signal in the cell. A *signal* in this context just means something that starts some process in the cell. The most important process the calcium transient drives is the *contraction* of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being a signal for contraction, calcium is a signal for a large amount of processes in the cell, both short term and long term. In the short term, elevated calcium levels can drive the activity of kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, exchangers and transporters. In the long term, elevated of levels of calcium can be responsible for function, growth, gene expression, differentiation, remodeling and development of cells."

When there is no calcium bound to calmodulin, it does nothing, but when calcium binds to it, it can bind to other molecules in the cell, triggering a chain of processes. These chains of processes are known as *signal transduction pathways*. One molecule that is activated by CaM is shown on the right, and is called *Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II*, or simply CaMKII. Kinases are a class of enzymes that drive *phosphorylation*, and when activated by calmodulin, CaMKII is involved in a large number of pathways.\n",

In addition, calcium handling is quite different across mammalian species, and understanding these differences is important if one wants to analyze experimental results across species.\n",

In addition mitochondria does absorb and extrude a small amount of Ca$^{2+}$, but this is such small amounts it is usually neglible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The t-tubules:** T-tubules (transverse tubules) are invaginations of the sarcolemma into the cell, effectively they give the cell a much larger surface area and ensures much of the internal volume of the cell has a short distance to the sarcolemma, ensuring swift and spatially homogeneous calcium influx into the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR):** The SR is an internal calcium storage inside the cell. The SR consists of a lipid bilayer membrane impermeable to Ca$^{2+}$ just like the sarcolemma. This internal membrane also has ion channels and pumps for calcium.\n",

Thus, the action potential triggers the L-type to open, and the inital calcium that enters the cell triggers a secondary release of calcium from the SR. This process is known as *calcium induced calcium release* (CICR). Under normal conditions, the calcium flux from the SR through RyR is much larger than the influx from outside the cell through the L-type channel.\n",

    "To remove calcium from the cytosol, it must be pushed against its concentration gradient, i.e., active transport is needed. Calcium is therefore removed from the cytosol through exchangers and pumps. The most important of these are the SERCA pump and the Na/Ca exchanger. The SERCA pump uses ATP to pump calcium back into the SR from the cytosol, this reduced the cytosol levels, but it also refills the SR calcium stores. The Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) pumps calcium ions through the sarcolemma, out of the cell, by coupling it to an influx of sodium. Sodium wants to enter the cell at resting, and so by coupling these two processes we can pump calcium out, by letting sodium in. Another pump in the sarcolemma is the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA), which also uses ATP to push calcium out. When comparing the two main sarcolemma calcium efflux by capacity, NCX is much more important, moving much more calcium than PMCA.\n",

    "## A super simple calcium decay\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to model how the cytosolic calcium levels return to baseline over time, following the rapid rise of the calcium transient. One of the simplest approaches we can take to this process is to model it as an exponential decay towards the baseline. The governing equation is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\rm d[Ca^{2+}]_i}{{\\rm d}t} = \\frac{\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_i - [Ca^{2+}]_i^{\\rm rest}}{\\tau}.$$\n",

    "Here, $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_i$, is the intracellular cytosolic calcium, which is the state variable, $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_i^{\\rm rest}$ is a constant parameter, denoting the baseline diastolic calcium level, and $\\tau$ is the time constant of the decay. This model thus has two free parameters, the baseline diastolic calcium in the cell, and the time constant (i.e., the speed) of the decay. These parameters can be chosen to best fit experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential decay model is very simple, having only two free parameters. It gives a decay that is large when the calcium levels are far from baseline, and then it slows down as it approaches baseline, which is physiologically accurate, it also slows down once the model reaches a baseline value, instead of completely emptying the cell of calcium, which is also reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as you've probably guessed, such a simple model will have considerable drawback. First of, it is a very heavyhanded model with no possibilities of regulation or adjustability. The baseline calcium for example, is fixed or \"clamped\", while in reality, it should be able to drift with changing activity. The decay rate in $\\tau$ should also be able to be regulated. Another issue is that this model does not track where the calcium actually goes, just that it leaves the cytosol. However, some calcium will leave the cell, while some will go into the SR, and it turns out that how much goes where is hugely important.\n",

    "## Calcium Cycling\n",
    "\n",
    "For each beat of the heart, there will be a release, and then reuptake of calcium, which in turn drives contraction. We refer to this process as *calcium cycling*, as the calcium moves back and forth in a cyclical manner. There are some subtle balances in this cycling that is very important for how the cell behaves, and how contraction of the cell is regulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that calcium *enters* the cytosol primarily from outside the cell through the L-type channel and from the SR stores through the calcium relase channels. We have also discussed how calcium *leaves* the cytosol primarily through the NCX, which pushes it out of the cell completely, and SERCA, which pumps it back into the SR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, an important factor of calcium cycling is that the total amount of calcium that enters the cell through the L-type channel must be the same amount that leaves through the NCX. The same is true for RyR and SERCA, the amount that gets released through RyR must be pumped by SERCA.\n",
    "$$\\int J_{\\rm LTCC} \\ {\\rm d}t = \\int J_{\\rm NCX} \\ {\\rm d}t, \\qquad  \\int J_{\\rm RyR} \\ {\\rm d}t = \\int J_{\\rm SERCA} \\ {\\rm d}t.$$\n",
    "It might not be immediatly clear why this must be the case. The heart is continiously pumping, and so the cell is continiously undergoing calcium cycling. If the activity of the L-type channel were not balanced up against the NCX, more calcium would either enter or leave the cell. This means the cell would either be losing calcium for each beat, untill it was completely empty, or it would gain calcium for each beat. This *drift* of calcium cannot be, so the net calcium change throughout one cycle has to be zero for long term stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/calcium_cycling.png\" width=400>\n",
    "**Figure:** For each beat, calcium is cycled into and out of the cell through the sarcolemma by the LTCC and NCX, and released and taken up into the SR by RyR and SERCA. These two \"cycles\" have to be balanced, otherwhise the system would drift over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our argument for this balance hinges on *long term* stability, but for a single beat, we can definitely see an imbalance in where calcium goes. If the heart is beating along at a constant rythm, and there are no changing conditions, it will eventually find a *steady cycle*, where things are balanced on a beat by beat basis. If we perturb this system, such as by increasing the heart rythm, things will be unbalanced for a while, untill the heart reaches a new balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main mechanism here is that if more calcium enters the cell through LTCC than leaves it through NCX, this calcium will eventually be pumped into the SR, and so the concentration in the SR will increase. If we have a higher *SR load*, the Ca$^{2+}$-release will also become stronger and so we reach a point where things find a new balance. In the new balance the calcium transient is stronger, which gives a stronger contraction. On the reverse side, if more calcium leaves the cell through NCX than enters it through LTCC, then less calcium will get pumped into the SR, and the SR load will drop. This will weaken the RyR release current untill things are in balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NCX and SERCA compete for the same cytosolic calcium. If one of them is more active, there is less cytosolic calcium available for the other. The balance between NCX and SERCA is therefore one of the main determinants of calcium cycling balance, and this will decide the SR load level, which again decides the Ca$^{2+}$-transient magnitude and therefore the strength of contraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exampleof this we can look at the balancing of NCX and SERCA in different species. In species with fast heart rhytms, and short APs, such as rat, there is less time for LTCC influx, and so we need a stronger internal release of calcium to compensate: this means SERCA has to be strong in comparison to NCX. On the other hand, a species with a slower heart rhytm and longer AP, more calcium enters the cell through the LTCC, and so NCX has to be stronger in relation SERCA, otherwhise there would be a build of calcium in the SR.\n",

SERCA harnesses this energy to pump 2 calcium ions into the SR, per single molecule of ATP.\n",

We can then use the exact same assumptions as we did when we derived the Michaelis-Menten equation.

    "The unidirectional model is very simple, both conceptually and in terms of mathematics and implementation. It has only two adjustable parameters. Here, $v_{\\rm max}$ is the maximal pump capacity, as it states how much SERCA can pump at maximal working conditions. Because SERCA is a high-capacity pump, this value should be large. The other parameter, EC$_{50}$, is the half-maximal saturation of the pump activity, i.e., how much calcium needs to be present for SERCA to reach half of its maximal potential. As SERCA is a high-affinity pump, it should be good at pumping, even at low concentrations, so high-affinitiy means a *low* EC$_{50}$ value. In mammalian myocyte, the best fit of this parameters is on the order of 0.3 µM, which is only a few hundred nM above baseline. \n",

    "Due to its simplicity, the unidirectional pump model sees quite some use. However, it does have some major issues, the biggest of which is that it does not care about the SR load whatsoever, in fact, this model predicts SERCA will keep pumping away calcium from the cytosol until there is nothing left. This is not only not physiological, it is *unphysical* as it breaks the law of thermodynamics, as we saw in our discussion above. Because of this, models that use a unidirectional SERCA pump often have to add a leak calcium current from the SR into the cytosol to balace the over-active SERCA. This can work in practice, but one always have to be very careful with such models, as they are not guaranteed to behave well with changing conditions.\n"

In the cytosol some of this calcium gets pumped back into the SR by SERCA, but as the RyR is open, this just goes right back into the cytosol. The NCX however, is also pumping calcium out of the cell, and this efflux of calcium we can measure through a patch clamp.

    "Another important phenomenological outcome of calcium cycling is that cardiomyocytes are self-regulating. Again, we will only show some examples of this, and not go into the finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure below is from a cardiomyocyte experiment. Here they are pacing the cell at a regular pace, and measuring the amount of shortening per beat. The shortening of the cell is proportional to the calcium transient. When pacing at a regular pace, the calcium transient and thus shortening is fairly constant, the cell is at a steady cycle. In the experiment, they now add a bit of caffine to the system. Caffine binds to the calcium release channels (RyR), making it easier for them to open. The easier opening gives a bigger calcium release and a much bigger transient. This response occurs very fast, and right after the caffine is introduced, we see a much larger shortening of the cell. However, over the next few beats, the shortening response becomes smaller and smaller untill it is back to its baseline. This is not due to any manipulation from our side, it is the cell that is self-regulating, or *auto-regulating* back to its baseline. To understand why this occurs, think of where the increased calcium is coming from. The caffine triggers bigger release from the SR, but the SERCA is not upregulated, and so this additional cytosolic calcium will be evenly split between NCX and SERCA. Some of the additional calcium will thus leave the cell, resulting in decreasing SR load with each beat. With decreasing SR load, the calcium release becomes weaker, untill we eventually reach a new equilibrium.\n",

    "When caffine is removed from the system, we see the opposite response. With no caffine, the RyR are again hard to open, leading to a smaller release of calcium from the SR (due to the low SR load). However, as the release is smaller, a relatively speaking larger amount of calcium is entering through the L-type than through the RyRs, and again, this calcium is split between NCX and SERCA. SERCA therefore refills the SR load for every beat, which leads to stronger release again, untill we are back to the baseline value we had earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same authors carried out the same experiment, but adding *tetracaine*  instead of caffine, which has the opposite effect on RyR, it inhibits release. Right after adding tetracaine to the system, the calcium release is much weaker, giving a small calcium transient and little shortening. However, over the next 10-20 beats, the cell is auto-regulating by increasing its SR load, untill we are back to nearly the same baseline as we started at. Taking tetracaine off the system gives the same behavior as when removing caffine, the increased SR load gives a larger shortening, but after some time the SR load has decreased back to its original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment they also measured both the L-type current and the NCX current of the cell, which when summed gives us a measure of the total amount of calcium entering and leaving the cell. We see that this measurement at baseline goes to 0 over one beat (measured points at a and c). This means there is no net calcium entering or leaving the cell, and thus the SR load is constant. However, after perturbing the system, we see that the integral does *not* go to 0. This means a net amount of calcium is either entering or leaving the cell (entering at point b, and leaving at point d). This calcium cannot be in the cytosol, so it has to end up in the SR.\n",
