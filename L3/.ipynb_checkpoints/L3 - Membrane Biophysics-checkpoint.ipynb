    "## The Cell Membrane\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now introduce the cell membrane, a very fundamental and important piece of understanding cell electrophysiology. The structure of the cell membrane is fairly complex, but its most fundamental units are quite simple, they are the *phospholipids*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/phospholipid.png\" width=250>\n",
    "\n",
    "Phospholipids are molecules that have a head consisting of a phosphate group, and two fatty acid tails. An important property of phospholipids is that the head is hydrophilic, while the tails are hydrophobic. Imagine we disolve some phospholipids in water. If the phospholipids were to spread evenly throughout the solutions, the hydrophobic tails would be very exposed to the water, this incurs a high energy cost due to hydrophobic interactions. This means that the phospholipids, rather than disperse evenly, will tend to clump together. This way they can attempt to partily shield their tails from the water, reducing the total hydrophobic interaction in the solution. This means phospholipids, despite being fairly simple molecules, spontaenously self-assemble into more complex structures where the tails are kept on the inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *lipid bilayer* is one such possible structure. In the bilayer, the phospholipids create two planar sheets that lie in barallell, with the tails of each pointing towards the center. The layers do not allow water to pass in, and so the structure very effectively hides the hydrophobic tails away from the water. There is no real limit for how large the bilayer can become, given enough phospholipid molecules, and the sheet is quite flexible, and so the whole sheet can loop back around and meet itself, giving a balloon structure we call the cell membrane. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/lipid_bilayer.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the closed cell membrane, we have a clearly inside and outside of the cell, which is often referred to as the *intracellular* and *extracellular* domains. The intracellular is also known as the cytosol of the cell. Note that \"inside the cell\" and \"inside the cell\" now means two different things. A typical cardiomyocyte is about 10 µm in diamter, the cell membrane itself being only about 5 nm thick, meaning the cell membrane is very thin compared to the size of the cell."

    "### Permeability of the membrane to charged particles\n",
    "\n",
    "The bilayer assembles as an entropic effect to reduce the net hydrophobic interaction. This means that the lipids in the membrane are more or less free to float around within the membrane plane in relation to each other. With this image, it is not hard to imagine smaller molecules being able to slip in between the lipids and move into, or through the membrane, without affecting the integrity of the membrane structure itself. However, the membrane is discriminatory, and does not treat all molecules that try to diffuse across the membrane equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The membrane self-assembled to hide the hydrophobic tails. Stated another way, there is a non-polar environment within the membrane. Outside the membrane, we have water, which is a polar environment. This means that the membrane itself is fairly permeable to non-polar, or fat soluable, molecules, but impermeable to polar molecules. Charged ions are polar molecules, and will therefore prefer to stay in the polar environment outside the membrane. Despite its fairly thin width of a few nanometers, the non-polar environment is very effective at shielding against charged ions. While there in reality always will be a few ions that leak through by chance, we can for our following discussion assume that this transport of charge through will be completely neglible.\n"

This means the membrane is an electric insulator. The inside and outside of the cell however, have many disolved charged ions, and so are both quite good electric conductors. When two electric conductors are separated by an insulator, we get what is known as an electric *capactior*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an electric potential is applied across a capacitor, an electric current wants to flow through, but the electric insulator prevents this, so instead we get a pileup of electric charge on one side of the insulator. This charge is felt by carriers of opposite charge on the other side of the insulator which will pile up on that side. These charges set up electric field that will be of equal strength to our applied voltage across the capactior. \n",

    "$$\\frac{{\\rm d} Q}{{\\rm d}t} = C_{\\rm m} \\frac{{\\rm d} V}{{\\rm d} t}.$$\n",
    "The time derivative of charge can be interpreted as a current, and we call this the *capacitive current*, or $I_{\\rm cap}$. The capacitive current is called a *virtual* current, as it isn't an actual carrier mediated current carried across the insulator (which cannot happen), but rather a current that comes from the charge build up or release of built up charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacitance of the membrane is about 1 µF/cm$^2$, which means that a whole cell has a capacitance of about 0.05 nF. That might seem like very little, but a Farad is a huge unit, and one mostly see capacitances in the pF to µF range. At the same time the cell is fairly small, meaning the 0.05 nF is quite a considerable capacitance."

Many such proteins exist and are used by the cell for many different things. For our discussion, the important proteins are the *ion channels*.

    "\n",
    "At the microscopic level, ions and molecules are not stationary, but rather zip around at high speeds due to *thermal motion*. If you were to look at a single molecule and track its motion, you would find it chaotic and hard to describe and predict. If we zoom out however, and look at a large number of particles simultaneously, we actually see very organized and deterministic behavior. The motion of a large number of particles is described through the process of *diffusion*, which in turn is described by Fick's laws of diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fick's First Law of Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Fick's first law of diffusion states that there will be a net diffusive motion of particles if there is a concentration gradient present. The flux of particles is proportional in magnitude to the concentration gradient. We can express it in 1D as \n",
    "$$J = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x},$$\n",
    "and in higher dimensions, such as normal 3D space, as\n",
    "$$J = -D \\nabla c.$$\n",
    "Here, $J$ is the net flux, $c$ the concentration and $D$ the proportionality constant, called the *diffusivity* or *diffusion coefficient*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fick's law holds true for each species independently, so it is often written with subindices\n",
    "$$J_k = -D_k \\nabla c_k.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that diffusion only describes the net motion of a large number of particles. If the concentration is constant throughout a container, there is no concentration gradient, and thus no diffusive flux. There is still chaotic molecular motion, but this will be of equal magnitude in all directions, and so the total or net motion is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what diffusion means for the behavior of the cell, let us look at an example. Assume we have a box, separated at the middle by a partition. The left side is filled with a gas, while the right is completely empty. If we now remove the partition, what happens? The gas will start to expand and fill the whole container, and eventually everything will be evenly spread throughout the container. At the molecular level, what has happened is that the gas molecules now are free to move around the entire container, and so they will, by random motion, tend to fill everywhere evenly. There is no force pulling the gas into the vacuum on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat the the thought experiment, but this time the right is filled with a different gas. What happens when we remove the divide now? The two gasses will diffuse past each other, and eventually we end up with a container with an evenly mixed and distributed mixture of gasses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ion channels in the membrane only create a pore for the ions to move through, the movement of the ions itself has to occur spontaneously. This is called *passive ion transport*, as the channel isn't actually doing any transporting, it only makes the ions spontaneous motion possible. The alternative is *active ion transport*, which is carred out by other membrane proteins known as ion pumps and exchangers. These active transporters spend energy in the form of ATP to pump ions, and so these proteins *actively* move ions around. An anaolgy: Passive transporters are like roads, they make it possible for cars to drive around, but the road itself doesn't push cars around. While active transports are more like car carrier trailers, actively moving cars around.\n",

There is a similar elevated level of negatively charged ions X$^-$-ions inside, so both sides of the membrane are electrical neutral, and we have no membrane potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume now, that at a certain time, some potassium ion channels in the membrane open, meaning potassium is free to move through these channels through the membrane. What will happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the channel opens, there is a concentration gradient for potassium, because the concentration is higher inside than outside. There is no electric field, as everything is electrical neutral. This means the Nernst-Planck equation reduces to Fick's law at this time, and potassium therefore starts to diffuse out of the cell. However, as K$^+$-ions start leavingt the cell, the negatively charged ions cannot follow, as there are no channels they can use. This means we end up with a net negatively charged inside, and a positively charged outside of the cell. This means that an electric field starts to emerge, inhibiting the potassium from leaving the cell. What effectively happens is that the potassium leaving the cell will be kept close to the membrane, while negatively charged ions inside the cell will be dragged towards the membrane. What is happening is the membrane is acting like a capacitor that is being charged. Eventually the membrane potential becomes strong enough for the diffusive flux and the electric drift to cancel out. We have now reached a new equilibrium. There is still a concentration gradient of potassium across the membrane, as well as a net membrane potential. But it is an equilibrium, as nothing is changing in time.\n",

If $I_{\\rm tot}$ was different from 0 there would be a net charge leaving the cell, which would not be sustainable over a longer time perspective, as charge separation requires large amounts of energy.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have only talked about ion channels as being present and open, and seing how transport of ions occurs passively through them. However, most channels open and close in response to different conditions, we call such channels *gated* ion channels. Understanding how the channels are gated is the final piece of the puzzle to understanding the action potential of the cell. The next session will discuss gated ion channels."
